# Contacts Module Frontend Implementation Notes

## Backend Coverage Analysis

### Models Implemented
- [x] Contact: All fields implemented, including `total_bookings` and `last_booking_date` which are updated by backend tasks.

- [x] GET /contacts/<uuid:pk>/ → `ContactDetail.tsx`
- [x] PUT /contacts/<uuid:pk>/ → `ContactForm.tsx` (full update)
- [x] PATCH /contacts/<uuid:pk>/ → `ContactForm.tsx` (partial update)
- [x] DELETE /contacts/<uuid:pk>/ → `ContactsList.tsx` (deletion action)
- [x] GET /contacts/groups/ → `ContactGroups.tsx`
- [x] POST /contacts/groups/ → `ContactGroupForm.tsx` (creation)
- [x] GET /contacts/groups/<uuid:pk>/ → `ContactGroupDetail.tsx`
- [x] PUT /contacts/groups/<uuid:pk>/ → `ContactGroupForm.tsx` (full update)
- [x] PATCH /contacts/groups/<uuid:pk>/ → `ContactGroupForm.tsx` (partial update)
- [x] DELETE /contacts/groups/<uuid:pk>/ → `ContactGroups.tsx` (deletion action)
- [x] POST /contacts/<uuid:contact_id>/groups/<uuid:group_id>/add/ → `ContactDetail.tsx` / `ContactGroupDetail.tsx`
- [x] POST /contacts/<uuid:contact_id>/groups/<uuid:group_id>/remove/ → `ContactDetail.tsx` / `ContactGroupDetail.tsx`
- [x] GET /contacts/interactions/ → `ContactInteractions.tsx` (all interactions)
- [x] GET /contacts/<uuid:contact_id>/interactions/ → `ContactDetail.tsx` (contact-specific interactions)
- [x] POST /contacts/<uuid:contact_id>/interactions/add/ → `AddInteractionModal.tsx`
- [x] GET /contacts/stats/ → `ContactsOverview.tsx`
- [x] POST /contacts/import/ → `ContactImportModal.tsx` (initiates async task)
- [x] GET /contacts/export/ → `ContactsList.tsx` (download action)
- [x] POST /contacts/merge/ → `ContactsList.tsx` (initiates async task)

### Business Logic Mapping
- **Contact Filtering**: Frontend implements UI for `search`, `group`, `tags`, and `is_active` query parameters for contact listing.
- **Contact Group Management**: Frontend allows adding/removing contacts from groups via both contact detail and group detail views.
- **Async Operations**: For `import_contacts` and `merge_contacts`, the frontend initiates the task and provides user feedback.
- **Statistics**: `ContactsOverview.tsx` displays all calculated statistics from the `/contacts/stats/` endpoint.

### Integration Requirements
- **Users Module**:
  - The `organizer` field in `Contact`, `ContactGroup`, and `ContactInteraction` is automatically handled by the backend based on the authenticated user.
  - The `useAuthStore` is used to determine the current user's authentication status.
- **Events Module**:
  - The `ContactInteraction` model has a `booking` foreign key. The frontend provides links from `ContactInteraction` entries to booking details.
  - The `total_bookings` and `last_booking_date` fields are updated by backend tasks from the Events module.

### Implementation Challenges
- **Tags Input**: Implemented user-friendly chip input for the `tags` JSONField on the `Contact` model.
- **Color Picker**: Implemented color picker component for `ContactGroup.color`.
- **Async Task Feedback**: Provides clear feedback for long-running background tasks like `import_contacts` and `merge_contacts`.
- **Merge UI**: Designed intuitive UI for selecting primary and duplicate contacts for merge operations.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE
All backend functionality has been successfully implemented in the frontend with 100% coverage.
